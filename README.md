# Ninja Gaiden 2 : analysis of gameplay through machine learning

The goal of this project is to analyze gameplay videos from video games and retrieve valuable information from it. For example, it could be to analyze a player's performance variations throughout the game which could help detect which parts are too unbalanced in difficulty, or to understand the best player's strategies in the form of statistics in order to reproduce them. For this project, I chose to work on Ninja Gaiden 2 for Xbox 360, as it's one of my favorite games and I would know what relevant features to extract from it.

## Data acquisition and preprocessing

I used videos from dangavsterGAMES's Youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpx5oke1hzifxaSuZPuaKbiSrcaAB79nw , I downloaded videos for chapter 2, 6 and 11 (there are 14 chapters in this game).
